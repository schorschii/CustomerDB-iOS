# Customer Database iOS
With this iOS app you can manage your customers separated from the private contacts, business appointments and vouchers. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/customer-database/id1496659447). It is also available for [Android](https://github.com/schorschii/customerdb-android).

Optionally, you can set up your own sync server using the [Customer Database Server](https://github.com/schorschii/customerdb-server), which is also Open Source.

Contributions welcome :-)
